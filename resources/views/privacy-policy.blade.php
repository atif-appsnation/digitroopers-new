                    <p>This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how Digitroopers, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Futurealiti” or “we” or “us”) uses personal information in running its business. Digitroopers is available from its websites, including but not limited to, www.Digitroopers.com (“Websites”) and mobile games/applications (“Mobile Apps”). We refer to our Website visitors and Mobile App users as users (“Users”) of Digitroopers Services (“Services”). Please read our&nbsp;Terms of Service&nbsp;and our “Cookie Policy” provided as Appendix B hereto. By visiting any of the Websites or using any of the Mobile Apps, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DOES DIGITROOPERS COLLECT?</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>User Provided Information.</strong>&nbsp;We obtain certain information when you provide it to us: for example, if your setup your account profile, participate in a discussion board or report a problem on one of the Websites, you may provide your name, email address, your date of birth, photograph, and a list of interests such as your favorite music and television shows. Some of that information can be used by Digitroopers to identify or contact you directly and is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Information from Use of our Services.</strong>&nbsp;Digitroopers also gathers non-personally identifiable information from Users of our Services. Non-personally identifiable information is information that usually cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include: the Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifiers, anonymous IDs for advertising, operating system, mobile network information, browser type, existing applications, browsing activity and non-precise device location information (e.g., city or region). Digitroopers may enable you to send messages to other Users in the Digitroopers community. We ordinarily don’t read the content of these messages unless we reasonably believe the Service is being misused or as required by law; we keep track of the number of messages sent and similar information to keep our Services running smoothly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Digitroopers Login.</strong> When you login directly through Digitroopers, we can access the information you provided during your account profile setup. Digitroopers may also incorporate alternative log in methods not listed here, which may follow a similar protocol to the log in methods listed above.</p>
                    <p><strong>Device Information.</strong>&nbsp; When you access the Services on your wireless device, we may obtain information from your wireless carrier about the type of device you are using. We may use this information to notify you about what type of features and products from Digitroopers may be available to you on your device.</p>
                    <p><strong>Mobile Phone Number.</strong>&nbsp; Certain features of the Services may require our collection of the phone number of your device. We may associate that phone number to the mobile device identification information. We will not use that number for telemarketing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Location.</strong>&nbsp; Depending on the provider, we may automatically receive general location information when you use our Services. In the future, if we begin to offer Services that use technology that pinpoints precise geolocation, we will ensure that we have your consent (an opt-in) before doing so. We may use and store this information to provide enhanced location-based Services as well as to serve location-targeted advertising without your express opt-in, which includes communication to third party Services providers who have agreed with Digitroopers to keep such information confidential and only use such information to the extent necessary to perform the Services as required by Digitroopers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Digitroopers uses a number of cookies to collect non-personal information for many purposes. You can see a list of the cookies we use in our “Cookie Policy”&nbsp;provided as Appendix B hereto. Please note that by using the Services you are consenting to the use of cookies.</p>
                    <p><strong>HOW Digitroopers USE INFORMATION?</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>User Provided Information.</strong>&nbsp;We use the personally identifiable information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Services to: deliver the products and services that you have requested, manage your account and provide you with customer support, communicate with you about products or services that may be of interest to you, and to monitor compliance with the rules governing the Services. We don’t sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.</p>
                    <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information from the use of our Services.</strong>&nbsp;Digitroopers analyzes non-personally-identifying information gathered from users of the Services to help better understand how our Services are being used and to help tailor content and advertising across the Services. By recognizing patterns and trends in usage, Digitroopers is able to better design the Services to improve Users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. We also may share non-personally-identifying information with third parties, including but not limited to advisors, advertisers, analytics providers, and investors, for the purpose of conducting business.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.</p>
                    <p><strong>DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
                        As reasonably necessary to provide services to you, Digitroopers may share non-personally identifying information or personally identifying information with its partners or affiliates, and also with third party vendors.</p>
                    <p>Digitroopers may disclose your information to third parties when obligated or permitted to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

                    <p>In addition, you may at any time review or change your personally identifiable information by contacting us at&nbsp;privacy@Digitroopers.com. Upon your request via email, we will deactivate or delete your account and contact information from our active databases in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law. Please note that we may be obligated to keep some of all of your information on our servers even after you’ve deleted your account.</p>
                    <p><strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
                        We use reasonable electronic, personnel, and physical measures to protect information from loss, theft, alteration, or misuse. However, please be advised that even the best security measures cannot fully eliminate all risks. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures.</p>
                    <p><strong>CHILDREN</strong><br>
                        We do not knowingly collect or store personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 unless or except as permitted by law.&nbsp;<strong>ANY PERSON WHO VISITS ANY OF THE WEBSITES OR USES ANY OF THE MOBILE APPS REPRESENTS TO US THAT HE OR SHE IS 13 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER AND HAS READ AND WILL ADHERE TO OUR&nbsp;“ONLINE SAFETY AND BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES”</strong> which is included as Appendix A hereto. If we are made aware that we have received personally identifiable information from someone under 13, Digitroopers.</p>
